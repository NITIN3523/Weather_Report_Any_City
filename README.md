This website is a single-page application (SPA), meaning it functions as a single interface and dynamically updates content without full page reloads. This approach enhances user experience.

The website boasts responsive design, ensuring optimal display and interaction across various devices (desktops, mobiles, tablets).

The ReactJS framework serves as the foundation for the website's structure and organization.

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, provides the website's styling.
